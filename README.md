# Welcome to My Exercism practises
Perform some tasks from Exercism website and have some fun.

#### The Command-Line Client (CLI)
For problems with the **Command-Line Client (CLI)**, open an issue in [exercism/cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues).

#### Exercises in a particular programming language
The exercises are all in separate, language-specific repositories. These repositories are tagged with the topic [`#exercism-track`](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aexercism-track+org%3Aexercism&type=Repositories). From there, search for the track (programming language) you are participating in.

## Where to find the code

The code for the website lives in [exercism/website](http://github.com/exercism/website).
